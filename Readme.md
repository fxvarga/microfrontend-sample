# ðŸ§© Microfrontend Federation Playground

Welcome to the **Microfrontend Federation Playground** â€” a modern monorepo architecture using:

- **Rsbuild** for fast, configurable builds
- **Module Federation** for dynamic runtime composition
- **pnpm workspaces** for efficient dependency management
- **`mf_workflow`** and **`mf_provider`** remotes for isolated microfrontends
- **`@shared/ui`** component library for reusable, styled UI components
- **Turborepo** for task orchestration and build performance

> Build scalable, composable frontends with minimal overhead and maximum modularity.

## How to Run the Full System

```bash
pnpm install       # Install all dependencies from the root
pnpm build         # Build shared-ui and both remotes (provider and workflow)
pnpm dev           # Start dev servers in parallel
```

### Local Dev Entry Points

- **mf_consumer** (host shell): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - Renders the `/workflow` route
  - Dynamically loads:
    - ðŸ”¹ `Workflow` component from **mf_workflow**
    - ðŸ”¹ `TaskList` component from **mf_provider**

- **mf_provider**: [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)
  - TaskList component

- **mf_workflow**: [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/)
  - Workflow component


## Example Workflow View
In this hypothetical view, we have a workflow service deployed to its own environment and we have a search service that would be able to provide, progress or consolidated status update on a specific task from a workflow. This allows interdependent services to expose UI components connected to their corresponding backend, these services own the data/deployment/logic and use shared components published by consolidation service. This ensures decentralized development and deployment while providing a unification service (mf_consumer) and a unified look and feel through shared-ui components.
